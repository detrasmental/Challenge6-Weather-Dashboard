# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## The Task 
Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
Use the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities. 

## User Story

AS A traveler  
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities  
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs  
WHEN I search for a city  
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history  
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city  
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index  
WHEN I view the UV index  
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe  
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city  
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity  
WHEN I click on a city in the search history  
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

### Credits & Resources
I struggled quite a bit with this challenge, getting the UV index to display properly was especially difficult for me. Multiple YouTubers with tutorials on pulling API's and building weather applications helped tremendously. W3schools.com was also a game changer.
